                                            If you’re wondering how to start a business, it may be easier than you
                                            think. Like other successful businesses, you’ll
                                            want to make sure you have a good idea first. From there, you can build a
                                            product or service that solves a need for
                                            consumers. But before you jump into anything, you’ll want to make sure you
                                            do your research. This is crucial, because
                                            only an estimated 79.4% of companies survive their first year in operation.1

                                            So, whether you’re starting a business in retirement or just looking to earn
                                            more cash, you’ll want to find the right
                                            startup growth strategies. Don’t be afraid of being a sole proprietorship
                                            and starting your company on your own because
                                            you can always grow and hire employees later on.

                                            Identify your target customers: You can do this by looking at who benefits
                                            from your product. You’ll also want to look
                                            at factors like age, location and even marital status.

                                            Look at competitors: Analyzing competing products or services can give you
                                            an idea of what already exists in your
                                            industry. This can help you find ways to improve your idea. It can also help
                                            you target weaknesses in your product or
                                            service before you spend time and money creating it. Be sure to note your
                                            competitor’s prices during this process, which
                                            will give you a range of how much customers are currently spending on
                                            similar products.
