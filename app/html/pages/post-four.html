                                            employees. Companies with low morale usually
                                            have unhappy and unproductive employees.

                                            Employee morale is the outlook, satisfaction, attitude, and confidence that
                                            team members have at work. It’s a reflection
                                            of how healthy company culture is, how well employees are supported, and how
                                            engaged employees are. It reveals the
