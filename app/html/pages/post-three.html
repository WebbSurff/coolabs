                                            Coworking spaces are becoming more popular every day, and many cities are
                                            home to one or two shared offices nowadays. In
                                            2018, an estimated more than 14.000 spaces were opened worldwide, and in
                                            2019 this number will only be higher. And the
                                            perfect coworking space probably exists.

                                        </p>

                                            This fast growth goes hand in hand with a growing number of freelancers,
                                            remote workers, and digital nomads. Many
                                            companies realize that working online saves a lot of money and keeps
                                            employees happy and motivated. Besides that, travel
                                            gains popularity every day, and more and more people prefer to be location
                                            independent.

                                            The freedom of working from home or working while traveling is great, but it
                                            has some downsides too. To work
                                            effectively, we need good internet, a comfortable workplace, and someone to
                                            brainstorm with once in a while. And thatâ€™s
                                            precisely why coworking spaces became so popular. They bring freelancers,
                                            small businesses, and travelers everything
                                            they need to work effectively and stay motivated.

                                            experience with different coworking spaces.
                                            We have visited many of them all over the world, and we have spoken to many
                                            coworkers and owners of different spaces.
                                            Based on what we have heard around us, we created a list of the boxes we
                                            think a perfect coworking space should tick.
